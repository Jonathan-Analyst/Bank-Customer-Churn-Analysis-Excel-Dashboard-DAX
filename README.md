## Project Title
Bank Customer Churn Analysis(Interactive Dashboard creation using Advanced Excel)
## Project Description
This project analyzes customer churn for a retail bank using **Excel dashboards** enhanced with **DAX measures**. The objective is to uncover insights into churn patterns across demographics, geography, satisfaction, and financial behaviors, and to propose actionable recommendations for retention strategies.
## Project Objectives
- Identify the churn rate and retention rate of customers.
- Analyze key drivers of churn such as age, gender, geography, product usage, and satisfaction.
- Compare customer balances and tenure between churned and retained customers.
- Provide actionable insights to reduce churn.
## Dataset Used

## Project Process
- Data Cleaning and Preparation in Excel.
- Data Modeling with customer churn records.
- DAX Measures were created to calculate KPIs such as churn rate, retention rate, averages, and balances.
- Dashboard Design using Excel charts and slicers for interactivity.
- Insights and Interpretation of visual trends and KPI metrics.
## KPI Questions
- What percentage of customers churned vs. retained?
- Which demographic groups (age, gender, geography) have the highest churn rate?
- How does churn vary by tenure, satisfaction score, and number of products?
- Do churned customers differ in terms of balance and credit score?
- What role do customer complaints play in churn?

## DAX Functions
### Insights
- **Churn Rate**: 20.4% overall.
- **By Credit Score**: Lower scores correspond to higher churn.
- **By Geography**: Germany shows the highest churn (32.4%), suggesting a localized issue.
- **By Gender**: Females churn more (25.1%) than males (16.5%).
- **By Tenure**: Tenure does not significantly reduce churn risk.
- **By Bank Balance**: Churned customers hold higher average balances ($91.1K vs. $72.7K).
- **By Satisfaction**: Customers with satisfaction level 2 churn most frequently.
- **By Complaints**: 99.5% of complaining customers churned, indicating service gaps.

### Final Conclusion
This analysis highlights that churn is influenced by geography, gender, satisfaction, and complaints more than tenure or card type. Key recommendations include:
- Addressing service gaps in Germany.
- Improving customer complaint resolution.
- Targeted retention programs for high-value, dissatisfied customers.
- Monitoring satisfaction closely as a leading churn indicator.
